        <p>
          IF A CUSTOMER CONTACTS REALMS HOSTING THROUGH A TICKET IN THE CLIENT
          AREA WITHIN 48 HOURS OF A INITIAL SERVICE PAYMENT, THAT DID NOT
          INVOLVE ANY COFFER FUNDS, REALMS HOSTING WILL ISSUE A REFUND AND
          TERMINATE THE SERVICE. WE MAY TAKE A SMALL PROCESSING FEE, TYPICALLY
          THE SAME PERCENTAGE WHICH WE ARE CHARGED ON THE INITIAL PAYMENT FROM
          THE PAYMENT GATEWAY.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN ALL OTHER CASES, REALMS HOSTING DOES NOT OFFER REFUNDS UNLESS
          REALMS HOSTING CANCELS A SERVICE FORCIBLY (AGAINST A RENTER'S WISHES).
          FOR THESE REALMS HOSTING-TRIGGERED FORCED-SHUTDOWN CASES, A PRORATED
          REFUND WILL BE PROVIDED TO COVER THE REMAINING PREPAID DAYS.
        </p>
        <p>
          SERVICES WE DON'T OFFER REFUNDS FOR: <br />
          - WE DO NOT OFFER REFUNDS FOR OUR SUPPORT ADDON OR ANY OTHER ADDON(S)
          <br />
          - WE DO NOT OFFER REFUNDS FOR ANY LOCATION TRANSFERS. <br />
          - WE DO NOT OFFER REFUNDS FOR ANY UPGRADES. <br />
          - PAYMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO ADD TO A CLIENTS WALLET. <br />

        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS ALSO THE CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBILITY TO CANCEL THEIR SERVICE BEFORE
          THE DUE DATE IF THEY DO NOT WISH TO BE CHARGED OR BILLED FOR IT. ANY
          REFUND REQUESTS MUST BE MADE THROUGH A TICKET SUBMITTED THROUGH THE
          CLIENT AREA, CANCELLATION REQUESTS ARE NOT REFUND REQUESTS. <br />
          ANY DISPUTES PLACED THROUGH PAYPAL MEANS YOUR SERVICE WILL BE
          AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATED AND YOU WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO A REFUND.
          MAKE SURE TO PLACE A TICKET ASKING FOR HELP FIRST AND IF WE CANNOT
